# K-Means_Clustering_Coursera_UoL_Banknote_Authentication

This repository contains the final project files for the K-Means clustering course on Coursera from the University of London, completed in September 2023. The project was to analyse the suitability of the dataset for analysis using K-Means clustering, and then perform the analysis and write a report to assess whether automation could be used to assess the authenticity of banknotes.
